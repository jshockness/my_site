                <p>I started coding when a few years ago and instantly fell in love with it. From the challenges to the limitless knowledge you can gain from coding is what got me.

                <h3>Architecture & Design</h3>
                <p>I was introducted to architecture at a young age due to construction being done on my house. I was drawn to how the architect can created a blueprint and from paper a structure is born. Studying architecture I learned that the architect actually explains everything that needs to be done to bring his vision to life right on the blueprint.</p>
